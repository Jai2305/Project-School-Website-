In lockdown period , the demand for oline platforms became prominent to handel almost every kind of tasks, including information gathering , financial account processing etc. 
During that period , I undertook the project of working on a School's website improving the layout, modernising the front end and strengthen the back end framework so that 
the website is more reliable and user friendly , 

Technology :
Front- end : HTML, CSS, JS, Node Js
Back- end :  PHP 
Data Processing : SQL

Status: the website is still under construction and not launched yet 
The code cannot be disclosed following orgaization policy, but some pictures are been uploaded in the repository, as a basic overview of the project
